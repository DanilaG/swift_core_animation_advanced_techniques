/*:
 The ```—ÅontentsRect``` allows us to specify a subrectangle of the backing image to be displayed inside the layer frame. It uses unit coordinates.
 - Note: The following coordinate types are used in iOS:
    - **Points** ‚Äî The most commonly used coordinate type on iOS and Mac OS. Points are virtual pixels, also known as logical pixels.
    - **Pixels** ‚Äî Physical pixel coordinates are not used for screen layout, but they are often still relevant when working with images.
    - **Unit** ‚Äî Unit coordinates are a convenient way to specify measurements that are relative to the size of an image or a layer‚Äôs bounds, and so do not need to be adjusted if that size changes.
 */
/*:
 - Important: It is actually possible to specify a ```contentsRect``` with a negative origin or with dimensions larger than {1, 1}. In this case, the outermost pixels of the image will be stretched to fill the remaining area.
