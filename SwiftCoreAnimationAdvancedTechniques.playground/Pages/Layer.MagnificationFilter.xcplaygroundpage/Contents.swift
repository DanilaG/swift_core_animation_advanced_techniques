 Use the ```magnificationFilter``` property to set type of algorithm for image minification/magnification.
 
 ```CALayer``` offers a choice of three scaling filters to use when resizing images:
 - **linear** (default, smooth the image)
 - **trilinear** (like linear, but improve performance by using additional memory)
 - **nearest** (this algorithm (known as nearest-neighbor filtering) just samples the nearest single pixel and performs no color blending at all)

//: ### Usage of MagnificationFilter
import UIKit

final class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Set image
        let image = UIImage(named: "one")!
        self.view?.layer.contents = image.cgImage
        self.view?.layer.contentsGravity = .resizeAspect
        
        // ‚ÄºÔ∏è Set magnificationFilter ‚úçÔ∏è ‚ÄºÔ∏è
        self.view?.layer.magnificationFilter = .nearest
    }
}

present(ViewController())
