/*:
 Unlike ```UIView```, which is strictly two-dimensional, ```CALayer``` exists in three-dimensional space. In addition to the position and anchorPoint properties that we have already discussed, ```CALayer``` has two additional properties, ```zPosition``` and ```anchorPointZ```, both of which are floating-point values describing the layer‚Äôs position on the Z axis.
 
 Note that there is no depth property to complement the bounds width and height. Layers are fundamentally flat objects. You can think of them as being a bit like stiff sheets of paper that are individually two-dimensional but that can be glued together to form hollow, origami-like 3D structures.
 
 - Note: Normally, layers are drawn according to the order in which they appear in the sublayers array of their superlayer. This is known as the **painter‚Äôs algorithm**.
